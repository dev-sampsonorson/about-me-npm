# A package about me

This is an npm package that tells you the very basic about me and links that will tell you more.

### Installation

`npx @sampsonorson/about-me`

### Acknowledgements

I got inspired to build this project by [Sam Bellen](https://sambego.tech). I built something similar 
which you can find [here](https://github.com/Sambego/about-me-npm).

I also got to know about it in the first place from his talk at [NG - BE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGvdqP70dzQ), 
where he talk about the JOSE specification.

Before getting to his talk, I was at [Angular Nation](https://www.angularnation.net), feeding my mind with knowledge 
about Angular and the ecosystem.
